### Common 3rd Party Packages

While Go's standard library is packed with awesome utilities that will likely cover 80%+ of your use cases, it's frequently useful to rely on well-maintained open source 3rd party libs to simplify generic tasks, such as advanced HTTP request routing, or responding to HTTP `OPTIONS` requests.

All of these packages will require installation via `go get host.com/import/path`. The list below is not an endorsement of these libraries, but merely a list that might be helpful for new developers:
